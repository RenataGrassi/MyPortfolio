  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <h3 style="text-align: justify;">
  I am an oceanographer, a programmer, and a freelancer who splits the time between life at the sea and life on land, building websites, blogs, and applications. 
  I started programming with R! when I was still a young aspiring oceanographer, in 2007. Then, I knew Matlab in 2013 
  thanks once again to oceanography and the huge amount of data that we need to process and analyze.
  I continued my coding journey and started learning Python in 2014. My curiosity and willingness to explore the
  fascinating and limitless world of technology drove me to other languages and tools like Ruby on Rails, Javascript, CSS, HTML, SQL, and Heroku.

  I especially enjoy assisting people with the development of their project websites by giving life and color to their ideas 
  and launching their work onto the world wide web. Please feel welcome to contact me if you want to talk about a project 
  you would like to publish online. Letâ€™s make it happen!
